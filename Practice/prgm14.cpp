/*Chef has recently introduced a feature which allows you to open any userâ€™s submitted code (not just your own), and ask an AI to explain that code in English. For example, you can go to https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/70530506 and click on "Analyse This Code".

But there is a restriction that the feature works only on codes which are at most 10001000 characters long. Given the number of characters, CC, in a particular code, output whether the feature is available on this code or not.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int c;
	cin>>c;
	if (c<=1000){
	   cout<<"Yes"<<endl; 
	}
	else{
	    cout<<"No"<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
