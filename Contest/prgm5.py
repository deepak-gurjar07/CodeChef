# '''Chef has an 8Ã—8 chessboard. He placed a knight on the square (X_1, Y_1). Note that, the square at the intersection of the i^{th} row and j^{th} column is denoted by (i, j)(i,j).

# Chef wants to determine whether the knight can end up at the square (X_2, Y_2) in exactly 100 moves or not.

# For reference, a knight can move to a square which is:

# One square horizontally and two squares vertically away from the current square, or
# One square vertically and two squares horizontally away from the current square
